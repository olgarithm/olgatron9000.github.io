		<p>Version control was honestly one of the hardest concepts I've had to reason through in my experience as a computer science students. People explained it to me countless times, but I still felt like I was missing some sort of magical piece that would help me unlock its secrets. The ease with which people would pull and push code was alarming... how could I do that if I couldn't even remember the commands I needed to type in? What is GitHub? Is that different than Git? Where am I pushing code to??</p>
		<p>This feeling of being overwhelmed is normal- let's fix it! :)</p>
		<p>Before we dive in too deep, let's take a step back and discuss why we might want version control. Imagine you're writing a haiku on a piece of paper about how much you love llamas and your first crack at it sounds like this: </p>
		<br/>
		<div class="code">
			<p>llamas are funny</p>
			<p>they are nice, soft to the touch</p>
			<p>and make me happy</p>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p>With poetry like this, let's just say that E.E. Cummings better watch his back! You take a break from your hard work and come back a few hours later to rearrange some words in your Pulitzer-Prize-worthy masterpiece:</p>
		<br/>
		<div class="code">
			<p>llamas are lovely</p>
			<p>they are cute, soft to the touch</p>
			<p>and make me joyful</p>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p>You wipe the sweat from your brow and gaze at the piece of art you titled "An Ode to Llamas." Suddenly, your messy younger brother trips and spills grape juice all over your poem, making the piece of paper completely illegible!! On the verge of tears, you try to remember the words and their placement in the poem, but as hard as you try, you just can't. Someone who had a far worse poem than you wins the Pulitzer Prize for poetry, and you spend the rest of your life being haunted by images of llamas.</p>
		<p>Okay, okay. So maybe that's a bit of an overreaction, but wouldn't it be nice to somehow revert to a previous version of your poem? And what if you thought the first version of your poem had better word choice, but you just couldn't remember what words you used? This is where the beauty of version control comes in.</p>
