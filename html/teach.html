		<p>I'm someone who loves sharing information and tips/tricks with other people. During my time at the University of Washington, I have been a teaching assistant for both CSE 142 and CSE 143, which comprise UW's introductory Java series. If you've never looked into TAing before, I highly recommend you consider it and contact me if you have any questions! :)</p>
		<p>As a large visual learner, I can't emphasize how helpful diagrams and whiteboard explanations are to me. This perspective has encouraged me to develop colorful graphics to drive home key points during my sections, which makes it easier for me (and hopefully others) to take in information:</p>

		<p>I'm not totally sure what I'll be doing on this part of my website, but I'll try to make it fun and informative.</p>
