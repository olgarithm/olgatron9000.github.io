		<p>I'm someone who loves sharing information and tips/tricks with other people. During my time at the University of Washington, I have been a teaching assistant for both CSE 142 and CSE 143, which comprise UW's introductory Java series. If you've never looked into TAing before, I highly recommend you consider it and contact me if you have any questions! :)</p>
		<p>As someone who is a large visual learner, I can't emphasize how helpful diagrams and whiteboard explanations are to me. This perspective has encouraged me to develop colorful graphics to drive home key points during my sections:</p>

		<br/>
		<p>This makes it easier for me (and hopefully others) to take in information!</p>
